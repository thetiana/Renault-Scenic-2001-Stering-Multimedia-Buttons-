Renault Scenic 2001 Stering Multimedia Buttons 

This projest hacks Multimedia Buttons of Renault Scenic 2001.

Known issues:

Rotating too fast rottary encoder leads to wrong command.

TODO:

Shift key return 2 possible values depend on rottary encoder position... have to be one command.

Debounse of the buttons - now the butons are "debounsed" by main loop delay.
